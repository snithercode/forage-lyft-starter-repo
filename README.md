# Lyft Rentals: Service Check Component

## Overview
This component is part of the Lyft Rentals back-end system, designed to assess whether a Lyft Rental Car requires routine service based on its parts' service status. This component enhances the reliability and efficiency of the Lyft Rentals fleet management by ensuring timely maintenance checks.

## Project Highlights
- **Architectural Redesign**: The project includes a detailed UML class diagram that outlines the new, reorganized architecture. This diagram serves as a blueprint for understanding the system's structure and relationships between classes.

- **Codebase Refactoring**: The codebase has undergone significant refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. The refactoring efforts were guided by the principles outlined in the newly designed architecture, resulting in a cleaner and more organized code structure.
  
- **Routine Service Detection**: A core functionality that determines whether a Lyft Rental Car is due for routine service based on various component wear and usage metrics. This feature ensures high standards of vehicle safety and reliability for users. The component is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new features and functionalities to adapt to future requirements of the Lyft Rentals system.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: This project adopts TDD practices, with unit tests that cover new functionalities and critical system
  components. These tests ensure that the system behaves as expected under various scenarios and provide a safety net for future code changes.
